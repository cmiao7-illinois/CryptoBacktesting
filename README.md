# Crypto BackTesting Framework

Python invokes the Binance data interface to implement low-frequency On-Balance Volume (OBV) and Ichimoku backtesting algorithms for cryptocurrencies. 

C++ reads HDF5 data to implement medium to high-frequency Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Parabolic SAR (PSAR) backtesting algorithms for cryptocurrencies. 

Genetic algorithms are utilized for iteration and parameter tuning, integrating multiple backtesting algorithms.
